# Multi-Language Translator with Text and Voice Outputs

## Project Overview

This project is a powerful web application that translates English text or audio into multiple languages and provides both text and voice outputs for each translated language. The application is built using Gradio, leveraging AssemblyAI for audio transcription, ElevenLabs for text-to-speech conversion, and the `translate` library for translating text into different languages. It offers a simple and intuitive user interface, making it easy to use for people from different linguistic backgrounds.

## Features

- **Text Input Translation:** Translate English text into multiple languages.
- **Audio File Translation:** Upload an audio file containing English speech, transcribe it, and translate it into multiple languages.
- **Recorded Audio Translation:** Record audio directly in the application, transcribe, and translate it into multiple languages.
- **Multiple Language Support:** Translate English into Russian, Turkish, Swedish, German, Spanish, Japanese, Hindi, and Telugu.
- **Voice Output:** Generate voice output for each translated language using ElevenLabs' text-to-speech service.
- **Intuitive UI:** Built using Gradio, the application offers an easy-to-use interface with tabs for different input methods and organized outputs for translated text and audio.
